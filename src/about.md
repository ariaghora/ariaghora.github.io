# About this website

This website is my personal website, where I write about my projects, my thoughts, and sometimes my life.
Though I wish this website can be useful for others, I mostly write to express myself as the priority.

## Errata policy

I am trying my best to make this website as error-free as possible, and filling it with timeless content.
If you find any errors (typographical, code, math equation, anything), please let me know by one of the following ways:
- Open an issue on [GitHub](//github.com/ariaghora/ariaghora.github.io/issues)
- Send me an email at [hello@ghora.net](mailto:hello@ghora.net)
- Send me a message on [Twitter](//twitter.com/aria_ghora)

It doesn't matter whether the typo is in very old articles or not.
I appreciate any help in making this website better.

## Language

This website is written mostly in English, but I also write articles in Indonesian (Bahasa Indonesia).
Articles written in English are marked with [ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§] sign.
I am not a native English speaker, but I will try my best.

## Website technical details

This website is statically generated using a custom golang program and hosted on GitHub Pages. 
It simply reads the markdown files and generates the html files and provides required assets.
Let me know if you are interested in the source code.
But if you are smart enough, you can probably figure out how it works by looking at the source code of this website.
It is not that complicated, anyway.

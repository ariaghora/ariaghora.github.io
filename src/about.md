# About me

- I have been working professionally with various clients across a wide range of machine learning domains, including demand forecasting, fraud detection, and computer vision tasks.
- I have been conducting research and publishing papers since my MS and PhD years, continuing through my career in industry.
- I am passionate about exploring the internal mechanisms of systems, especially in the machine learning field. This includes investigating the inner workings of algorithms, tensor implementations, autograd systems, and GPU pipelines.
- I enjoy programming in high-performance languages such as Rust and C for various purposes, from extending Python and writing faster programs to developing my own libraries.
- I love exploring other domains as well, such as systems programming, high-performance computing, and graphics programming.

# About this website

This website is my personal website, where I write about my projects, my thoughts, and sometimes my life.
Though I wish this website can be useful for others, I mostly write to express myself as the priority.

I am not a native English speaker, but I will try my best.

## Website technical details

This website is statically generated using a custom golang program and hosted on GitHub Pages.
It simply reads the markdown files and generates the html files and provides required assets.
Let me know if you are interested in the source code.
But if you are smart enough, you can probably figure out how it works by looking at the source code of this website.
It is not that complicated, anyway.
